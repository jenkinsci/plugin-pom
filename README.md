# Parent POM for Jenkins Plugins

[![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/jenkinsci/plugin-pom.svg?label=changelog)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/plugin-pom/releases/latest)
[![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/github/license/jenkinsci/plugin-pom)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/plugin-pom/blob/master/LICENSE)

## Introduction

The plugin parent POM is decoupled from the core Jenkins project, both from a Maven perspective and a repository perspective.
It provides a common build configuration for all Jenkins plugins.

## Requirements

Since version 4.52, the plugin parent POM requires Jenkins 2.361 or newer and JDK 11 or newer.
Since version 4.40, the plugin parent POM supports Java 17.

## Usage

To use the plugin parent POM, change the parent POM of your plugin:

```xml
  <parent>
    <groupId>org.jenkins-ci.plugins</groupId>
    <artifactId>plugin</artifactId>
    <version>VERSION</version> <!-- See https://github.com/jenkinsci/plugin-pom/releases for available versions-->
    <relativePath />
  </parent>
```

Then override the needed properties, e.g.:

```xml
  <properties>
    <!--
    Take a look the developer documentation for the baseline version to use
    https://www.jenkins.io/doc/developer/plugin-development/choosing-jenkins-baseline/#currently-recommended-versions
    -->
    <jenkins.version>2.361.4</jenkins.version>
  </properties>
```

If you have a `jar:test-jar` execution, delete it and add the following to `<properties>`:

```xml
<no-test-jar>false</no-test-jar>
```

## Overridable properties

The following properties are overridable:

* `jenkins.version`: The Jenkins version required by the plugin. **Mandatory.** See [Requirements](#requirements) for more info. Being able to specify the `jenkins.version` simplifies testing the plugin with different core versions, which is important (among other reasons) for Plugin Compatibility Testing (PCT).
* `jenkins-test-harness.version`: The [JTH version](https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins-test-harness/releases) used to test plugin. Uses split test-harness (see [JENKINS-32478](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-32478)).
* `hpi-plugin.version`: The HPI Maven Plugin version used by the plugin. (Generally you should not set this to a version _lower_ than that specified in the plugin parent POM.)
* `stapler-maven-plugin.version`: The Stapler Maven plugin version required by the plugin.
* In order to make their versions the same as the used core version, `node.version` and `npm.version` properties are provided.

## Incrementals

You can configure your plugin to treat every commit as a release candidate.
See [Incrementals](https://github.com/jenkinsci/incrementals-tools) for details.

## Formatting

To opt in to code formatting of your Java sources and Maven POM with Spotless,
define the `spotless.check.skip` property to `false` and remove any existing
Spotless configuration from your POM.

To format existing code, run:

```bash
mvn spotless:apply
```

After formatting an existing repository, squash merge the PR and create a
[`.git-blame-ignore-revs`](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/using-files/viewing-a-file#ignore-commits-in-the-blame-view)
file to hide the formatting commit from blame tools.

## Running Benchmarks

To run JMH benchmarks from JUnit tests, you must run you must activate the `benchmark`
profile. For example:
```bash
mvn -P jmh-benchmark test
```
When the `jmh-benchmark` profile is enabled, no tests apart from JMH benchmarks will be run.
The names of the classes containing the benchmark runners should either begin with or
end with the word `Benchmark`. For example, `FooBenchmark` and `BenchmarkFoo` will
be detected when using `-Dbenchmark`, however, `FooBar` will be ignored.

See also: [documentation for JMH benchmarks](https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins-test-harness/blob/master/docs/jmh-benchmarks.adoc)

## Javadoc

Javadoc has been set to _quiet_ by default in 2.20+, which means it will only log errors and warnings.
If you really want it verbose, set `quiet` property to `false` for the plugin.

## Releasing

Tests are skipped during the `perform` phase of a release. This can be overridden by setting `release.skipTests` to false.

## Setup Wizard

By default, the setup wizard (Jenkins >= 2.0) is skipped when using `hpi:run`. If you want the wizard to be enabled just run:

```bash
mvn -Dhudson.Main.development=false hpi:run
```

## Jenkins Core BOM

Since version 2.195, Jenkins provides a [Maven Bill Of Materials (BOM)](https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-dependency-mechanism.html#Importing_Dependencies)
that centrally defines versions of various libraries used by Jenkins Core and should make it easier to update to newer Jenkins Core versions

For more information, see the [Dependency Management](https://jenkins.io/doc/developer/plugin-development/dependency-management/) section of the
[plugin development guide](https://jenkins.io/doc/developer/plugin-development/).
